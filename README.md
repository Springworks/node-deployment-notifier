Lets you know when you should deploy and when the deployment is complete.

Useful when:

- You need a human to make a decision of which version to deploy (if you want to do that when committing, look at [semantic-release](https://www.npmjs.com/package/semantic-release) or similar).
- You're using Slack
- You have another webhook that also needs to record deployment
